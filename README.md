# bridge-oscillation-estimator
This project contains four COMPUTER VISION algorithms, three of them calculate the oscillation frequency for a structures as a bridge, which is data necessary to monitor engineering structures health. 
You could test each algorithm with some tests videos, which shows graphics of frequency. The idea is to compare computational efficency and accurate frequency results.

1. Eulerian Video Magnification: this algorithm is a visual help to perfom motion amplification in order to perceive tiny movements that human eye can't see without this processing method.
2. Matching Templates: calculates frequency using motion calculation comparing two templates in each frame.
3. Optical Flow: calculates frequency using pixel velocity between frames. 
4. Phase Correlation: This simple method estimates motion using a correlate method.
